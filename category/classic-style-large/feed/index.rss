				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s important to be realistic about what you can afford. The final sale price isn’t the only cost to take into account when owning a home. Houses come with plenty of bills like heating and property taxes, future renovations and occasional unforeseen costs like burst pipes or city trees needing to be trimmed.</p>
<h4>Mistakes of First Time Buyers</h4>
<p>Or, you may spend too little. Yes, this can also be a mistake! If you spend too little on a home that you’ll outgrow quickly, you’ll incur the expense of moving (which can be quite pricey) perhaps before you need to. <div id="sc_slider_1266157067" class="sc_slider sc_slider_swiper sc_slider_controls sc_slider_pagination sc_alignleft swiper-slider-container" data-interval="5000" style="height:230px;width:50%;"><ul class="slides swiper-wrapper"><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-5-344x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/new-post-with-image/" title="New Post With Image"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-12-346x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/are-you-ready-to-rent/" title="Are You Ready to Rent?"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-4-353x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/is-condo-life-for-you/" title="Is Condo Life For You?"></a></li></ul>
					<ul class="flex-direction-nav">
					<li><a class="flex-prev" href="#"></a></li>
					<li><a class="flex-next" href="#"></a></li>
					</ul><div class="flex-control-nav"></div></div> Blindly buying a home can be a big mistake. Whether you’re paying too much attention to your realtor and family “who just LOVE the place!” or are feeling the pressure to make a quick buy, moving into a house that hasn’t been thoroughly vetted can be a big, expensive, regretful mistake. What you can do about it: Do your research! And do it first-hand. No realtor or family member can know exactly what you want more than you. Spend a day walking the neighbourhood, learn about your neighbours, research the local school and visit the parks. As for the house itself, get an inspection report. These can uncover unseen things like termites and flooding, two expensive undertakings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes one of the selling points a seller gives me about their home is &#8220;the neighbours are great.&#8221; It&#8217;s something that many of us take for granted and don&#8217;t pay attention to when we buy a home. It most definitely can blight the enjoyment of your home when you realize that you are in the wrong neighbourhood or living next door to a disruptive or nosey neighbour. There is not much you can do about it once you buy the home, so you are best to do your investigative work before hand. </p>
<h4>Know your neighbours before you buy</h4>
<p>Your realtor can give you an overview of the neighbourhood, telling you about nearby amenities and a general feel for the demographic of the area. For example, you may be looking for more mature residents to be the majority, or alternatively, more young families. You may want a condo complex with only a few tenants, or you may be looking for the exact opposite with a neighbourhood known for auxiliary apartments and renters. The realtor will also make you aware of upcoming zoning changes or new construction of highways or housing that may affect the enjoyment of your home and the resale value. <div id="sc_slider_1405427539" class="sc_slider sc_slider_swiper sc_slider_controls sc_slider_pagination sc_alignleft swiper-slider-container" data-interval="5000" style="height:230px;width:50%;"><ul class="slides swiper-wrapper"><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-5-344x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/new-post-with-image/" title="New Post With Image"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-12-346x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/are-you-ready-to-rent/" title="Are You Ready to Rent?"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-4-353x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/is-condo-life-for-you/" title="Is Condo Life For You?"></a></li></ul>
					<ul class="flex-direction-nav">
					<li><a class="flex-prev" href="#"></a></li>
					<li><a class="flex-next" href="#"></a></li>
					</ul><div class="flex-control-nav"></div></div> Some neighbourhoods and complexes have their own websites now, where you can learn about events and get some information about the atmosphere. Be sure to check the local police station website or in person to find out about traffic problems, and crime statistics and compare to other neighbourhoods. Make sure to ask for an analysis of the statistics, as some of the most exclusive neighbourhoods in major cities suffer from high crime rates, from auto theft, not violent crimes, so a quick explanation may calm your fears, especially if you drive an old clunker that no one would want to steal! </p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing better than first hand information so I always ask my clients to do a drive by of any property they are interested in, and at various times of day. They can get a feel for traffic issues, and the neighbourhood character and they may even stop and ask a few questions of people as they rake their lawns or walk their dogs. People love to talk about their homes, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you have to turn off the car and settle in for a long chat as you may learn a lot from the people in the neighbourhood.</p>

 Don’t be afraid of multiple offers. You still have some control. There are a few things that can happen if you get into competition. The seller can accept your offer and you will have bought a house. Or the seller can accept someone else’s offer and you need to keep looking. Or the seller can work with your offer, and sign it back to you with a counter-offer that you can accept or decline, and perhaps even counter-offer back to them.</p>
<h4>Taking Charge in a Bidding War</h4>
<p>There is another scenario that I despise, but unfortunately it happens: the seller has a number of offers on the table, and decides to send them all back for improvement. Personally, I think they should just choose the best one and accept it or work with it. In the case where you are sent back to improve, you have control and choices. The seller is actually at risk if the offer is signed back to you and a higher figure is requested. You can simply walk away from the deal, as you are not obligated to increase your money or change any terms of the agreement. You can resubmit your offer as is, or you can make some improvements to the offer by way of increasing the money or removing a condition or changing any term on the contract that the seller wasn’t happy about.</p>
<p>Just remember, although emotions run high and it’s not the most fun scenario for buyers, you should keep your head about you, and understand that you are always in control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<audio src="http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laura.mp3" class="sc_audio"  controls="controls" width="100%" height="155" style="margin-bottom:30px;" data-title="Insert Audio Title Here" data-author="Lily hunter"></audio> Termites are tiny wood-boring insects that are extremely destructive to homes and other buildings. They have been around since the beginning of time because they are adaptable to ever-changing environments. The most common type found, subterranean termites, is extremely tough to control. They’re of increasing concern to homebuyers in North America because they can cause serious structural damage.</p>
<h4>All truth about termites</h4>
<p>Termites live in the soil, but feed off the cellulose in wood, breaking it down and returning it to the soil. Be forewarned that any untreated wood that comes into direct contact with the soil surrounding a home provides a perfect entry point for those destructive, menacing insects. And because they basically never stop working and eating for even a minute out of the day, their ability to tunnel their way through a home’s wooden structure and leave it destroyed is truly frightening. An average termite colony is over one million strong, and thanks to the fact that they remain unseen and cause their destruction under the surface, they can be very difficult to detect. If they are found in a home’s support beams, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of those beams, they can put the entire home at risk!</p>

The seller may qualify the stated asking price as firm or negotiable. Firm means the seller is saying he or she will not change the price. Negotiable means the seller is inviting the potential buyer to attempt to convince the seller to lower the price. In bid and ask, the term ask price is used in contrast to the term bid price. The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the spread.</p>
