				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<audio src="http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/laura.mp3" class="sc_audio"  controls="controls" width="100%" height="155" style="margin-bottom:30px;" data-title="Insert Audio Title Here" data-author="Lily hunter"></audio> The factors that make a good tenant can vary, based on the landlord and the individual renter. Few universal characteristics hold true &#8211; some pet owners are wonderful tenants; some quiet tenants are asking to be evicted. Since most property owners can&#8217;t spend the time to really get to know each applicant, here are a list of the qualities they might watch for when renting out their homes. Find out if you are a desirable tenant, or if your application would raise warning flags.</p>
<h4>Are You Employed?</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s an obvious one. Tenants that are stably and gainfully employed have the best chance of fulfilling a landlord&#8217;s number one need: having the rent paid in full and on time. The best tenants will be secure in their employment, and earning enough to comfortably afford the rent – even in the event of unforeseen costs. If you are a student, you will have to show proof of how you intend to pay your rent. Some landlords may prefer a student who has their parents paying rent over a recent graduate with an unstable employment situation.</p>
<h4>Are You Single or a Couple?</h4>
<p>If you are part of a couple where you are both employed, that means two income streams to rely on to pay the rent. However, having two tenants may increase costs may be included in your rent, such as water and power usage. How long you&#8217;ve been together may also factor into the decision. Couples that have been together consistently over a longer period of time are seen as more stable and less likely to have to end their lease due to a break up. For a young couple that is moving in together for the first time, that risk may be perceived to be higher. </p>
<h4>Are You A Pet Owner?</h4>
<p>While many pet owners like to think their animal would never be any trouble, many landlords simply will not rent to people with pets. For responsible owners with well-trained animals, this is an unfortunate reality. Concerns your prospective landlord might have include damage to the unit, allergy concerns (in shared space), the safety of other tenants in the building, and noise complaints. </p>
<p>No matter what, be honest on your application and with your potential landlord. Lying about having a pet, your need to practice the drums or how many people will be living there will only hurt you in the long run. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since a home buyer apportions the bulk of his savings and income to a single investment, he wants to save as much as possible. Property developers exploit this penny-pinching penchant by offering various innovative schemes that are laden with freebies. At face value, most of these options appear tempting, but when you scrub off the gloss, you&#8217;ll discover that they are riddled with traps.<br />
Starting a search without clearly knowing what you want and then “hoping the ideal property will turn up!” With this approach, chances are you will waste plenty of time and energy and possibly purchasing something that doesn’t meet your needs or is beyond your budget!</p>
<p>Not doing the hard yards – the temptation is to cut corners on your research because you’re sick and tired of giving up your weekends looking at property but this is likely to be one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make so you want to get it right! The better you know the area, the better you will become familiar with prices and importantly you’ll know how to spot great value when you see it!<br />
5Forgetting about buying costs – remember to add stamp duty and settlement costs into the mix. This is usually up to an additional 5% on top of the purchase price that needs to be factored in when setting your budget.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like many homeowners out there, you may be thinking about taking advantage of the low mortgage rates out there and refinance your home loan. If so, make sure you avoid these four common mistakes refinancers make:</p>
<h5>Not Knowing Your Real Rates</h5>
<p>When you’re looking at rates, make sure you’re comparing your APR (annual percentage rate) to know what your true rate will be. Check out our website to see a comparison of rates from various lenders to see which lender offers you the best rate.</p>
<h5>Choosing the Wrong Loan Type</h5>
<p>After you figured out you want to refinance, take time to establish what your objective is. Do you want to lower your overall payment regardless of the length of the loan? Do you want to be debt-free by a certain year? Consider the cost of the refinance in comparison to the financial benefits – is it worth it? Once you’ve answered these questions, talk to one of our loan officers to hear what type of loan will help you accomplish your goals.</p>
<h5>Not Keeping Up With Your Borrower Responsibilities</h5>
<p>As your lender, you rely heavily on us; however there are some obligations you have to take care of on your own. Make sure you have decent credit and avoid taking on any more debt, even after the refinance has been approved. Also, to make sure you get that low rate you worked so hard to find, check your lock-in dates so that you secure that interest rate, and make sure you turn in all documentation that’s needed as soon as it’s requested so you don’t delay your closing date, jeopardizing your interest rate. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s important to be realistic about what you can afford. The final sale price isn’t the only cost to take into account when owning a home. Houses come with plenty of bills like heating and property taxes, future renovations and occasional unforeseen costs like burst pipes or city trees needing to be trimmed.</p>
<h4>Mistakes of First Time Buyers</h4>
<p>Or, you may spend too little. Yes, this can also be a mistake! If you spend too little on a home that you’ll outgrow quickly, you’ll incur the expense of moving (which can be quite pricey) perhaps before you need to. <div id="sc_slider_910077078" class="sc_slider sc_slider_swiper sc_slider_controls sc_slider_pagination sc_alignleft swiper-slider-container" data-interval="5000" style="height:230px;width:50%;"><ul class="slides swiper-wrapper"><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-5-344x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/new-post-with-image/" title="New Post With Image"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-12-346x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/are-you-ready-to-rent/" title="Are You Ready to Rent?"></a></li><li class="swiper-slide" style="background-image:url(http://quicksale.themerex.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-4-353x230.jpg);width:50%;height:230px;"><a href="http://quicksale.themerex.net/is-condo-life-for-you/" title="Is Condo Life For You?"></a></li></ul>
					<ul class="flex-direction-nav">
					<li><a class="flex-prev" href="#"></a></li>
					<li><a class="flex-next" href="#"></a></li>
					</ul><div class="flex-control-nav"></div></div> Blindly buying a home can be a big mistake. Whether you’re paying too much attention to your realtor and family “who just LOVE the place!” or are feeling the pressure to make a quick buy, moving into a house that hasn’t been thoroughly vetted can be a big, expensive, regretful mistake. What you can do about it: Do your research! And do it first-hand. No realtor or family member can know exactly what you want more than you. Spend a day walking the neighbourhood, learn about your neighbours, research the local school and visit the parks. As for the house itself, get an inspection report. These can uncover unseen things like termites and flooding, two expensive undertakings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A housing cooperative, or co-op, is a legal entity, usually a corporation, which owns real estate, consisting of one or more residential buildings; it is one type of housing tenure. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as single family ownership, condominiums and renting.[</p>
<p>The corporation is membership-based, with membership granted by way of a share purchase in the cooperative. Each shareholder in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members’ resources so that their buying power is leveraged, thus lowering the cost per member in all the services and products associated with home ownership.</p>
<p>Another key element is that the members, through their elected representatives, screen and select who may live in the cooperative, unlike any other form of home ownership. Housing cooperatives fall into two general tenure categories: non-ownership (referred to as non-equity or continuing) and ownership (referred to as equity or strata). In non-equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement, which is similar to a lease. In equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporation&#8217;s articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperative&#8217;s rules.</p>
